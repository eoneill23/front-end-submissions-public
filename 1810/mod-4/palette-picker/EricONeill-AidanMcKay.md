 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/JellyBeans1312/palette-picker-ui/blob/9ca9a1f59a94d3219a517d8d108437ba9014096b/src/containers/App/App.js#L31-L44)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Lines 31-44: hexCodeGenerator function. We are proud of this functionality because it is a recursive function, and we had the opportunity to use a package to generate a random color, but we wrote a recursive function instead even though it took much longer.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/JellyBeans1312/palette-picker-ui/blob/9ca9a1f59a94d3219a517d8d108437ba9014096b/src/containers/App/App.js#L70-L87)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Lines 17-31: updatePalette function. This function calls our method to patch the palette. As you can see, it wasn't very well-structed as we had to pull indices out of various arrays. This is defniitely an opportunity to refactor.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
[design inspiration](https://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/infographic-design-with-colorful-parallelograms_6823105.html)    
- We really liked the rhombus/parallelogram shapes from this example. We decided to implement them as a way to be unique from the standard rectangle or circle shapes.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Although we don't feel super comfortable with it yet, it is MUCH easier than front-end testing.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- Deploying the back end was fairly straightforward, but we had MAJOR issues trying to deploy our front end that we were never able to solve despite a ton of research and asking for help. We can see why it is a useful step between development and production environments.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- It was interesting to see how apps that are broken out communicate, especially since that will be our life once we get jobs!
